              As a designer and coder, I would have loved to been apart of
              Figma, Adobe, Procreate, or Photoshop. Any platform designed to
              help others create.

              As of recently I have taken up photography and basketball. I was
              thinking of creating a gallery website for my photos soon!

              The only movies I would take with me are Blade Runner 2049, Fight
              Club, and Edward Scissorhands. AND if I had to choose two more it would be Interstella and The Place 
              Beyond the Pines. Honestly any Ryan Gosling movie. I love movies.
